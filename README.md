## Assignment Overview
This program reads the adjacency matrix of a graph through inputting the file name in the command line. Then, through a menu, the user can choose to display the list, perform different searches, or traverse the graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

## Resources
Lecture Notes from Weeks 10-12 were used to understand the assignment with more depht and pseudo codes were followed for performing the searching algorithms.

## Implementation
Program is fully functional and performs all the required tasks.

## Compiling
To compile a4:

$ make

To execute:

$ ./a4 "filename.txt"

## Files
main.c
- Contains main function of a4, where menu is displayed and functions are called
graph_functions.c
- Contains function definitions
graph.h
- Contains headers for function declaration of graph_functions.c
